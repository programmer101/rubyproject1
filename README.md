first ruby on rails website

This is my first ruby on rails website. It is a website for restaraunt voting. It has two pages -- welcome and add restaraunt. The welcome page connects to a database of restaraunts and displays the restaraunts in a table. The table has fields for restaraunt name, address, and rating. The add page has fields for the user to fill in to create a restaraunt to add to the database.
